        This has been a blast to make, I'll admit I did not put much effort into the
        content, I more or less just wanted to showcase what I'd learned over the last
        hour and make sure I understood the basic concepts. I'd like to think that for
        only using HTML, it turned out pretty well. After I learn some CSS and JavaScript,
        I will come back to this and update.
